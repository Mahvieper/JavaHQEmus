Somethings are buggy but it gives a working HQ Java GUI capable ~10,000 accounts (as long as you have the bearers and open ports to connect).

Installation: <br />1. Download IntelliJ (The Community Version is Free)<br />2. Make a new project from Version Control and connect to your github account to download.<br />3. Make a tokens.txt and input your bearer tokens there every new line is a new token.<br />4. Run Main.Java

Requirements:<br />JDK 1.8

Libraries:<br />WIP

Feel free to fork this project or to mess around in the code. If you have any questions about the code contact me on discord.<br />If having trouble installing don't hesitate to send me a dm on discord.<br />This is for educational purposes only. This program violates HQ ToS if used on more than one account in a real broadcast.


HQ Terms of service states: <br /> "Each HQ user may establish, maintain, use and control only one account. <br />Each account on the may only be owned, maintained, <br />used and controlled by one individual."
