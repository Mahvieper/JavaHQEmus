Feel free to fork this project or to mess around in the code. If you have any questions about the code contact me on discord.<br />If having trouble installing don't hesitate to send me a dm on discord.<br />This is for educational purposes only. This program violates HQ ToS if used on more than one account in a real broadcast.
